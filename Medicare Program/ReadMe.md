About this Project:

Download the latest data set for Hospital Compare from data.medicare.gov and un-compress it into numerous files in csv format.

Create an SQL based database, create a table to hold each of the files in the data set, and parse and load each of the data files into a table in the database. 

There is a proprietary in-house system that creates our own ranking of hospitals and a list of focus states for analytics. 

The file produced will be an MS Excel workbook with 2 sheets.
One sheet will have a ranking of hospitals and the other sheet will have a list of focus states. 

Download this spreadsheet and read the data for use in further analytics.
Perform analytics using the data loaded into SQL and produce 2 MS Excel Workbooks.

The first workbook will have hospital ranking information. It will have 1 sheet with the top 100 hospitals nationwide. 
For each of the states in the focus group, it will have the top 100 hospitals for that state.

The second workbook will have a statistical analysis of the measures used to determine hospital ranking. 
It will have 1 sheet with each of the measures, along with the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation for that measure for all hospitals. 
For each of the states in the focus group, it will have the same statistics for each measure, but only for hospitals in that state.
